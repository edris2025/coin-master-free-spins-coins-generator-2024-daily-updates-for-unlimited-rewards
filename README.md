### Why Do You Need Free Spins and Coins in Coin Master?

In Coin Master, spins and coins are the backbone of your progression. Spins allow you to earn coins, attack other villages, and raid for loot. Coins, in turn, are essential for upgrading your village, which ultimately helps you reach new levels. Here’s why they’re so valuable:

1. **Faster Village Upgrades**: Each village has a set number of structures to build or upgrade, which cost more coins at each level. Without enough coins, progression slows down, making free coin offers valuable.
2. **More Chances for Raids and Attacks**: Spins let you attack or raid other players’ villages for extra resources. Each spin could result in a jackpot!
3. **Protection from Attacks**: With enough coins, you can repair damage and shield your village from opponents' attacks.
